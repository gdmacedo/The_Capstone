# The Capstone - Project of the Johns Hopkins University Data Science via Cousera
This Shiny application is part of the final project of the Developing Data Products course, where we cover the basics of data product creation using Shiny, R and interactive graphics packages.

Summary

The purpose of this app is part of the final project of the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization course through coursera.org. For the purpose of creating a predictive text application that predicts the next word to type while the user types a word or phrase.

To perform the processing we will use Markovâ€™s natural language processing language to evaluate the statistical probabilities of the next word that appears based on the appearance of the previous word (s). This report will go into the details of the Corpora we have available and briefly discuss possibilities for modeling the data to achieve the ultimate goal.

Where we find in this menu, the following options:

* **The Application** : Option where the user will make use of the application. Entering a sentence consisting of multiple words into an input box, with a minimum of 3 words.

* **Project** : In this option we show you about the details of this application.

* **The Author**  : Basic information of the author of this application regarding their knowledge related to Data Sciences. 

* **The Specialization**  
 * **About** : Information related to the specialization in which this application came to fruition; 
 * **The Courses** : List of modules, courses that make up this specialization.

* **Help** : Information related to this application.
